# Bloomington EOC Citizen Report Companion App
This project contains the source code of an Android app that allows users to submit reports of incidents that will be displayed on the [web-based dashboard](https://github.com/su20-elliott-i516/bton_eoc_web_dashboard).

The app was written in Kotlin and will create records in a Cloud Firestore database.  These reports will then display on the [dashboard](https://su20-i516-final-eoc.web.app/) in real time.

## Sideloading the App
If you have an Android device and want to test an unsigned app, you can download the [APK file](https://github.com/su20-elliott-i516/android_bton_citizen_reporter/blob/master/elliott_i516_demo.apk) to your device.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will have to quit and restart the app after giving it permission to access your location.  (Sorry.)
