# Bloomington EOC Citizen Report Companion App
This project contains the source code of an Android app that allows users to submit reports of incidents that will be displayed on the [web-based dashboard](https://github.com/su20-elliott-i516/bton_eoc_web_dashboard).

The app was written in Kotlin and will create records in a Cloud Firestore database.  These reports will then display on the [dashboard](https://su20-i516-final-eoc.web.app/) in real time.
